    <h1> Morning <br> 9am to 12pm </h1>
    <h2> <div class= "time">9am</div> <br> <div class="caption">Emptying the Restrait Drying System </div><br> It's important to open the system and unload the handmade paper as soon as you come in, so that we can load new handmade paper into it for the new work day. On March 7th, my Papermaking class began Chancery Papermaking. A papermaking technique dating back to 11th century medieval Europe, performed by only a 3 person team, my class used similar processes in order to make over 100 sheets of paper in 4 hours. </h2>
