Ever since senior year of high school, I've started a found collection of my favorite movies involving strong female leads, classic/amazing horror movies, or classic cartoons. The rule that I gave myself though is that they have to be found for under $10 or given as a gift, so I find a lot of the great classics in bargain bins and thrift shops and it's like an adventure when I'm bargain shopping. </div></h4>
